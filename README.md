# AND Project 3 - Popular Movies Stage 2

## Project Overview

This is Project 3 for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree.  This app will:

- Show you a grid of movie posters from [The Movie DB](https://themoviedb.org).
- Allow you to change the Sort order through a Settings menu.
- Allow you to tap on a movie poster to see additional details.
- View and play trailers (either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- Read reviews of a selected movie.
- Mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button (star).
- Use Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel and Lifecycle) to create a robust and efficient application.
- Create a database using Room to store the names and ids of favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to display the favorites collection while offline).
- Allow you to show your favorites collection using a Settings menu.

**Note:** You will need your own API key from [The Movie DB](https://themoviedb.org).
